# IN PLAY

## LEADS:

Same style of leads is used against both suit and NT contracts, in
partners suit and during play.

I) Honour Leads (honour = AKQJ10(9))

A asks for reverse attitude *(if dummy has a singleton then partners
signal becomes suit preference)*

K asks for reverse count

Q asks for reverse attitude (*if dummy has a singleton then partners
signal becomes suit preference)*

J promises the 10 *(partner usually gives a reverse count signal)*

10/9 promises either 0 or 2 higher honour (eg **10**9x, **9**xx,
KJ**10**x, Q10**9**x). *(partners signal is reverse attitude)*

*Lead honour from a honour doubleton*

ii) Leads from length with an honour

Usually lead low (4<sup>th</sup> best) unless obvious reason not to. If
leader has “suggested” a 6+ card suit then lead 6<sup>th</sup> best.

Iii) Leads from length without an honour

Usually lead 2<sup>nd</sup> highest from four or more *(play (original)
4<sup>th</sup> best next round)*

Usually lead top of three small cards *(next card is suit preference)*

Usually lead low from a small doubleton

## SIGNALS:

Basic principle is reverse (attitude and count). Unless the lead
specifies reverse count is the default unless it is clear that attitude
is more appropriate. Suit preference is also widely used and
particularly in trumps.

## DISCARDS:

Basic principle is reverse (attitude and count). The default is
generally attitude but may be count or suit preference in circumstances
where it is more appropriate.

## SPECIAL SITUATIONS WHICH INFLUENCE LEADS/SIGNALS/DISCARDS

*Lightner double (usually of a slam) – requests an unusual lead (partner
will usually have a void)*

*Following a double of 3NT (no bidding by our side) – lead dummys suit
or if no suit partner has a cashing suit; (dbler has bid) – lead a
different suit; (leader only or both have bid) – lead your suit. If
partner doubles a cue bid of a suit he has bid it suggests a different
lead; if partner doubles then it suggests leading the suit*
